The MC analysis has been produced using [lstmcpipe](https://github.com/cta-observatory/lstmcpipe) installed on the LST collaboration computing cluster at La Palma.

The configurations to handle the productions are provided here.

The first production is the `20221021_crab_full_lstchain097` handling the production of DL1 data without NSB tuning.    

The second one is `20221027_v0.9.9_crab_tuned` handling the production of DL1b data with NSB tuning for the Crab sample and the training of random forests.
